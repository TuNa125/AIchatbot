Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. <br>2. Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or adult-onset) results from the body ineffective use of insulin. <br>To learn more please type continue in the chatbox below ;) <br>To quit please type quit in the chatbox below :)"
